    <hr />
    <p>
      Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber; December 28, 1922 – November 12,
      2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer.
      He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel
      Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion
      from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation
      that dominated the comics and film industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists
      Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popular fictional
      characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor,
      the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil,
      Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, the Black Widow and Captain Marvel. These
      and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more
      naturalistic approach than previously applied to superhero comics, and in
      the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority,
      indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the
      development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
      Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public
      figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in films
      and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he received an
      executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative
      ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of
      Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the
      NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 800">Early life</h3>

    <p>
      Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New
      York City, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents,
      Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and
      West End Avenue. Lee was raised in a Jewish household, and in a 2002
      interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, "Well, let me put
      it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I really
      don't know. I just don't know." On another interview from 2011, when asked
      about his Romanian origins and his relationship with the country, he said
      that he had never visited it and that he did not know Romanian because his
      parents never taught it to him. Lee's father, trained as a dress cutter,
      worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, and the family moved
      further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue, in Washington Heights,
      Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber. He said in 2006
      that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those
      with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles. By the time Lee was in his teens,
      the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The
      Bronx. Lee described it as "a third-floor apartment facing out back". Lee
      and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout
      couch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. In his youth, Lee
      enjoyed writing and entertained dreams of writing the "Great American
      Novel" one day. He said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as
      writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National
      Tuberculosis Center; delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to
      offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser
      manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway; and selling
      subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper. At fifteen, Lee
      entered a high school essay competition sponsored by the New York Herald
      Tribune, called "The Biggest News of the Week Contest." Lee claimed to
      have won the prize for three straight weeks, goading the newspaper to
      write him and ask him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look
      into writing professionally, which Lee claimed "probably changed my life."
      He graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a half, in 1939 and
      joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.
